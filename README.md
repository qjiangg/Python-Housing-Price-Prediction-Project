**House Price Prediction Project**

The "House Price Prediction" project aims to forecast housing prices using machine learning techniques. By utilizing popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and XGBoost, this project offers an end-to-end solution for accurate price estimation.

### Project Overview

This project seeks to build a predictive model for housing prices based on various features. Housing price prediction is highly relevant in real estate and finance, helping buyers, sellers, and investors make informed decisions. By using machine learning algorithms and a carefully curated dataset, this project provides a powerful tool for price estimation.

### Key Features

- **Data Collection and Processing**: The project leverages the "California Housing" dataset, available from the Scikit-learn library. The dataset includes features such as house age, number of rooms, population, and median income. Pandas is used to process and prepare the data for analysis.

- **Data Visualization**: Data visualization techniques are employed to extract meaningful insights. With Matplotlib and Seaborn, visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices are created to understand feature relationships and identify trends in the data.

- **Train-Test Split**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the train-test split technique. This ensures that the model is trained on one subset of the data and evaluated on unseen data, providing a robust assessment of its performance.

- **Regression Model using XGBoost**: The project utilizes XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm, to build a regression model. Known for its accuracy in handling complex feature relationships, XGBoost is implemented via the Scikit-learn library.

- **Model Evaluation**: The model’s performance is evaluated using metrics like R-squared error and mean absolute error (MAE). R-squared measures the variance explained by the model, while MAE quantifies the average error between predicted and actual prices. A scatter plot of predicted vs. actual prices further illustrates the model’s accuracy.
